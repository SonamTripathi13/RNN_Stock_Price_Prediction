## RNN_Stock_Price_Prediction
## Stock Price Prediction using Simple RNN ,Advanced RNN

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using various Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architectures, including Simple RNN, Advanced RNN. The models are evaluated based on their performance, primarily using R² scores and loss metrics.

## Project Overview

- Objective: Predict stock prices using historical data through deep learning.
- Techniques:
  - Data preprocessing and sequence generation
  - Implementation of multiple RNN-based models (Simple RNN, LSTM, GRU)
  - Model comparison and performance evaluation using R² scores
- Tools: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy

## Files

- RNN_Assg_Stock_Price_Prediction_Sonam_Nguyen_Vinita.ipynb: Main notebook containing all code and analysis
- README.md: Project documentation

## Models Implemented

- Simple RNN
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Grid search and hyperparameter tuning for optimization

Each model is trained on the same sequence of preprocessed stock data, allowing direct performance comparison.

## Results Summary

- Models are compared using:
  - R² Score for regression accuracy
  - Loss curves for convergence evaluation
- Observations include trade-offs in complexity, training time, and predictive accuracy

## Requirements

- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
